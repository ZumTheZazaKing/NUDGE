The 90-Second Pitch Script (for "NUDGE")
(0:00 - 0:15) — The Hook & The "Delulu"

(Start with high energy)

"Good evening! We’ve all been there. It’s 1 AM. You told yourself you’d log off hours ago. But you're still scrolling, still coding, still lost in 'just one more video.'

That's the 'delulu' of the digital age: thinking we have self-control.

The 'solulu'? We’ve tried gentle solutions. Pomodoro timers we ignore. Notifications we swipe away. They don't work. Why? Because they have no consequences."

(0:15 - 0:30) — The Solution: NUDGE

"That’s why we built NUDGE.

NUDGE isn't a gentle reminder. It's a digital intervention. It’s tough love, in software form. It’s designed to make you actually log off and touch grass.

Here's how it works. You're your own boss. You set your screen time limit."

(0:30 - 0:50) — The Live Demo: Arming the Trap

"Let's open the control panel. I'll tell NUDGE that my productive time is over in... let's say... 10 seconds.

(Show the app, enter 0, 0, 10)

I hit 'Begin Countdown.' The app disappears. It's now silently watching from the system tray.

(Point to the tray icon)

...3... 2... 1... It’s armed. Now, as long as I’m away from the computer, everything is fine. But I'm 'delulu.' I'm going to try and keep working. I just need to send one more email..."

(0:50 - 1:15) — The Demo: Springing the Trap

"Watch what happens the moment I move the mouse...

(Move the mouse. An ENTITY or JUMPSCARE fires).

WHOA! Okay, that’s my first NUDGE. But I'm persistent. I'm going to try and type...

(Click in a text editor and press a key. NOTEPAD pops up and types 'RUN.')

It's possessed! It's typing at me. But I'm still here! I'm still trying to close the windows...

(Move the mouse more. POPUP HELL or SCREEN FLIP triggers).

It's chaos! It's launching popups, it's flipping my screen, it's fighting me at every turn! This is unusable!"

(1:15 - 1:30) — The Clincher

"NUDGE makes being online more painful than logging off. The only way to stop this... is to do what I should have done an hour ago: shut down the computer.

It’s the ultimate 'solulu' for your 'delulu' screen addiction.

We're NUDGE. Thank you."
